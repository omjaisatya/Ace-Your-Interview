# Software Testing Interview Questions and Answers

## 1. What is Software Testing?

**Answer:**
Software testing is the process of evaluating a software application to identify defects and ensure that it meets the specified requirements. It involves executing the software under controlled conditions to detect errors, gaps, or missing requirements.

## 2. What are the different types of Software Testing?

**Answer:**
There are several types of software testing, including:

- **Manual Testing**: Executing test cases manually without automation.
- **Automation Testing**: Using tools to execute test cases.
- **Functional Testing**: Testing functionalities as per requirements.
- **Non-functional Testing**: Testing aspects like performance, security, usability, etc.
- **Unit Testing**: Testing individual components of the software.
- **Integration Testing**: Testing combined modules.
- **System Testing**: Testing the entire system end-to-end.
- **Regression Testing**: Ensuring new changes don’t break existing functionalities.
- **Acceptance Testing**: Verifying if the software meets business requirements.

## 3. What is the difference between Verification and Validation?

**Answer:**

- **Verification**: Ensures that the product is being developed correctly (process-oriented). Example: Reviews, walkthroughs.
- **Validation**: Ensures that the developed product meets the user requirements (product-oriented). Example: Functional testing, user acceptance testing.

## 4. What is the difference between Black Box and White Box Testing?

**Answer:**

- **Black Box Testing**: Testing without knowledge of internal code structure. Focuses on input/output.
- **White Box Testing**: Testing with knowledge of internal code. Focuses on logic and structure.

## 5. What is a Test Case?

**Answer:**
A test case is a set of conditions or steps executed to verify a specific feature or functionality of a software application. It includes:

- Test Case ID
- Description
- Pre-conditions
- Test Steps
- Expected Result
- Actual Result

## 6. What is a Test Plan?

**Answer:**
A test plan is a document that outlines the scope, objectives, resources, schedule, and approach of the testing process. It helps in organizing and managing the testing activities effectively.

## 7. What is Regression Testing?

**Answer:**
Regression testing is performed to ensure that recent code changes have not affected the existing functionalities of the software. It is executed after modifications, bug fixes, or enhancements.

## 8. What are the different levels of Software Testing?

**Answer:**

1. **Unit Testing** – Testing individual components.
2. **Integration Testing** – Testing the interaction between modules.
3. **System Testing** – Testing the entire system.
4. **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)** – Ensuring the software meets business needs.

## 9. What is the Difference between Smoke and Sanity Testing?

**Answer:**

- **Smoke Testing**: Performed to check if the build is stable enough for further testing.
- **Sanity Testing**: Conducted after minor changes to verify specific functionalities.

## 10. What is the Difference between Static and Dynamic Testing?

**Answer:**

- **Static Testing**: Involves reviewing documents, code, and design without executing the software (e.g., code reviews, walkthroughs).
- **Dynamic Testing**: Involves executing the software to validate its behavior.

## 11. What is Exploratory Testing?

**Answer:**
Exploratory testing is an informal testing approach where testers actively explore the application without predefined test cases, identifying defects based on experience and intuition.

## 12. What is Defect Life Cycle?

**Answer:**
The defect life cycle (or bug life cycle) consists of the following stages:

1. **New** – When a defect is identified.
2. **Assigned** – Assigned to a developer.
3. **Open** – Under investigation by the developer.
4. **Fixed** – Developer fixes the defect.
5. **Retest** – Tester verifies the fix.
6. **Closed** – If verified successfully.
7. **Reopen** – If the defect persists.

## 13. What is Performance Testing?

**Answer:**
Performance testing evaluates a system’s speed, stability, scalability, and responsiveness under load. It includes:

- **Load Testing**: Testing under expected load.
- **Stress Testing**: Testing under extreme load.
- **Scalability Testing**: Checking the system’s ability to scale.

## 14. What is Security Testing?

**Answer:**
Security testing ensures that the software is protected against threats, vulnerabilities, and unauthorized access. It includes:

- Authentication Testing
- Penetration Testing
- Data Security Testing

## 15. What is Test Automation?

**Answer:**
Test automation is the use of tools to execute test cases and compare actual results with expected results automatically. Examples: Selenium, JUnit, TestNG.

## 16. What is Continuous Testing?

**Answer:**
Continuous testing is the practice of executing automated tests as part of the software delivery pipeline to obtain immediate feedback on business risks.

## 17. What is a Test Coverage?

**Answer:**
Test coverage measures the amount of testing performed, ensuring that all requirements and code paths are tested.

## 18. What is Boundary Value Analysis (BVA)?

**Answer:**
BVA is a testing technique that focuses on testing at the boundary values of input domains, as defects are more likely to occur at these points.

## 19. What is Equivalence Partitioning?

**Answer:**
Equivalence partitioning is a testing technique that divides input data into valid and invalid partitions, reducing the number of test cases while ensuring good coverage.

## 20. What are Some Popular Software Testing Tools?

**Answer:**
Some widely used software testing tools are:

- **Selenium** (Automation Testing)
- **JMeter** (Performance Testing)
- **Postman** (API Testing)
- **TestNG** (Unit Testing)
- **QTP/UFT** (Functional Testing)
- **Appium** (Mobile Testing)

## 21. What is a Test Environment?

**Answer:**
A test environment is a setup that includes the necessary hardware, software, network configurations, and test data required to execute test cases.

## 22. What is End-to-End Testing?

**Answer:**
End-to-end testing validates the complete workflow of an application from start to finish, ensuring that all integrated components work as expected.

## 23. What is Monkey Testing?

**Answer:**
Monkey testing is an ad-hoc testing technique where testers provide random inputs to the application to identify unexpected behaviors or crashes.

## 24. What is Ad-hoc Testing?

**Answer:**
Ad-hoc testing is an informal testing approach where testers explore the software without predefined test cases, relying on intuition and domain knowledge.

## 25. What is the Difference Between Retesting and Regression Testing?

**Answer:**

- **Retesting**: Testing a specific defect after it has been fixed.
- **Regression Testing**: Testing the application to ensure recent changes haven’t affected existing functionalities.
