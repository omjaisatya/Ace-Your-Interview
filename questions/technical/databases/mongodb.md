# MongoDB Interview Questions

## 1. What is MongoDB?

**Answer:**
MongoDB is a NoSQL database designed for scalability and flexibility. It stores data in a format similar to JSON called BSON (Binary JSON), which allows for the storage of complex data structures and hierarchical data.

## 2. Explain the key features of MongoDB.

**Answer:**

- **Schema-less Design:** MongoDB does not require a predefined schema, allowing for flexible and dynamic data structures.
- **Document-Oriented Storage:** Data is stored in documents (BSON format), making it easier to model and retrieve complex data.
- **Scalability:** Supports horizontal scaling through sharding and vertical scaling through replica sets.
- **Indexing:** Provides rich indexing options to optimize query performance.
- **Aggregation Framework:** Allows for advanced data processing and analysis operations.
- **High Availability:** Ensured by replica sets, which provide automatic failover and data redundancy.

## 3. What is a document in MongoDB?

**Answer:**
In MongoDB, a document is a basic unit of data, stored in BSON format. It is analogous to a row in relational databases and can contain various data types, including nested structures and arrays.

## 4. What is a collection in MongoDB?

**Answer:**
A collection is a grouping of MongoDB documents, similar to a table in relational databases. Collections are schema-less and can store documents with different structures.

## 5. What is a replica set?

**Answer:**
A replica set is a group of MongoDB servers that maintain the same data set. Replica sets provide redundancy and high availability, as they automatically failover to a secondary node if the primary node fails.

## 6. How does sharding work in MongoDB?

**Answer:**
Sharding in MongoDB distributes data across multiple servers or shards to ensure horizontal scalability. Each shard contains a subset of the data, and the sharding key determines how data is distributed. MongoDB handles routing of queries and balancing of data across shards.

## 7. Explain the difference between `find()` and `findOne()`.

**Answer:**

- **`find()`:** Returns a cursor to all documents that match the query criteria. It can be used to retrieve multiple documents.
- **`findOne()`:** Returns a single document that matches the query criteria. It is typically used when only one document is expected.

## 8. What is an index in MongoDB?

**Answer:**
An index in MongoDB is a data structure that improves the speed of data retrieval operations. Indexes are created on fields to optimize query performance and support efficient data access.

## 9. How can you create an index in MongoDB?

**Answer:**
Indexes can be created using the `createIndex()` method. For example:

```javascript
db.collection.createIndex({ field: 1 });
```

BSON (Binary JSON) is a binary representation of JSON-like documents. It extends JSON’s capabilities by including additional data types, such as `Date` and `Binary`, and providing efficient serialization and deserialization.

## 18. Describe the purpose of the `$match` stage in the aggregation pipeline.

**Answer:**
The `$match` stage in the aggregation pipeline filters documents based on specified criteria, similar to a `find()` query. It only passes documents that meet the criteria to the next stage in the pipeline.

## 19. What is the purpose of the `$group` stage in the aggregation pipeline?

**Answer:**
The `$group` stage is used to group documents by a specified identifier and perform aggregation operations, such as counting, summing, or averaging. It helps in summarizing data across groups.

## 20. Explain the use of the `$lookup` stage in MongoDB.

**Answer:**
The `$lookup` stage performs a left outer join with another collection, allowing you to combine documents from different collections based on a matching field. It enables the aggregation of related data across collections.

## 21. What is the difference between `replaceOne()` and `updateOne()`?

**Answer:**

- **`replaceOne()`:** Replaces a single document that matches the query criteria with a new document. The entire document is replaced.
- **`updateOne()`:** Updates specific fields in a single document that matches the query criteria, leaving other fields unchanged.

## 22. How does MongoDB handle large objects, such as images or videos?

**Answer:**
MongoDB handles large objects using GridFS, a specification for storing and retrieving large files. GridFS divides the file into smaller chunks and stores them as separate documents in two collections: `fs.chunks` and `fs.files`.

## 23. What are MongoDB’s data consistency models?

**Answer:**
MongoDB offers several consistency models:

- **Read Concern:** Determines the level of isolation for read operations (e.g., `local`, `majority`).

The `$unwind` stage deconstructs an array field from the input documents to output a document for each element of the array. It is used to normalize data and perform operations on array elements.

## 28. Explain the concept of eventual consistency in MongoDB.

**Answer:**
Eventual consistency means that while data changes are propagated to all nodes in the replica set, there may be a delay before all nodes reflect the latest data. This model ensures high availability and performance but may result in temporary discrepancies.

## 29. What is the purpose of the `db.collection.stats()` command?

**Answer:**
The `db.collection.stats()` command provides detailed statistics about a collection, including document count, storage size, index size, and other performance metrics. It helps in analyzing and optimizing database performance.

## 30. Describe how you would model a one-to-many relationship in MongoDB.

**Answer:**
A one-to-many relationship can be modeled in MongoDB by embedding the "many" documents within the "one" document as an array. Alternatively, you can reference the "many" documents by storing their IDs in the "one" document and querying them separately.

## 31. What is the purpose of the `db.collection.find()` method in MongoDB?

**Answer:**
The `db.collection.find()` method is used to query a MongoDB collection and retrieve documents that match the specified criteria. It returns a cursor that can be iterated over to access the result documents.

## 32. How do you use the `$or` operator in MongoDB queries?

**Answer:**
The `$or` operator allows you to specify multiple conditions in a query, and it will return documents that match any of the specified conditions. For example:

```javascript
db.collection.find({ $or: [{ field1: value1 }, { field2: value2 }] });
```

## 33. Explain the concept of "Write Concern" in MongoDB.

**Answer:**
Write Concern defines the level of acknowledgment requested from MongoDB for write operations. It determines the level of assurance that data has been written to the database. For example:

- `w: 1` ensures that the write is acknowledged by the primary node.
- `w: "majority"` ensures that the write is acknowledged by a majority of the nodes in the replica set.

## 34. What is a "Database Profiler" in MongoDB, and how is it used?

**Answer:**
The Database Profiler in MongoDB is a tool used to collect and analyze performance metrics and query execution statistics. It helps identify slow-running queries and optimize performance. It can be enabled using `db.setProfilingLevel()` and analyzed using the `system.profile` collection.

## 35. What is the `writeConcern` parameter, and how does it impact database operations?

**Answer:**
The `writeConcern` parameter specifies the level of acknowledgment for write operations. It impacts database operations by determining how many nodes must acknowledge a write before it is considered successful. Higher levels of write concern provide greater data durability but may impact performance.

## 36. Describe the `MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline`.

**Answer:**
The MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline is a framework for processing and transforming data in stages. Each stage performs a specific operation (e.g., filtering, grouping, sorting) and passes the results to the next stage. The pipeline provides a powerful way to aggregate and analyze data.

## 46. What is the role of the `mongod` and `mongos` processes in MongoDB?

**Answer:**

- **`mongod`:** This is the primary MongoDB server process that handles data storage, processing, and management. It is responsible for handling read and write operations.
- **`mongos`:** This is a routing service used in sharded clusters to direct client requests to the appropriate shards. It manages query routing and aggregation across the cluster.

## 47. How does MongoDB handle data replication?

**Answer:**
MongoDB handles data replication through replica sets. A replica set is a group of MongoDB servers that maintain the same data set. One member is the primary node that handles all write operations, while secondary nodes replicate the primary’s data. If the primary node fails, an election process promotes a secondary node to primary.

## 48. What is a `write concern` and how does it impact performance?

**Answer:**
Write concern defines the level of acknowledgment required from MongoDB for write operations. For example, `w:1` means the write must be acknowledged by the primary node, while `w:majority` requires acknowledgment from the majority of nodes in a replica set. Higher write concerns provide greater data durability but can impact performance due to increased acknowledgment requirements.

## 49. How can you optimize query performance in MongoDB?

**Answer:**
Query performance can be optimized by:

- **Creating Indexes:** Add indexes on fields that are frequently queried.
- **Using Efficient Queries:** Write queries that leverage indexes and avoid full table scans.

## 56. What is `MongoDB Change Streams`?

**Answer:**
MongoDB Change Streams allow applications to access real-time changes to data in a collection or database. They enable applications to listen to changes (e.g., inserts, updates, deletes) and respond to them in real-time, supporting use cases such as event-driven architectures.

## 57. Describe how you would use the `bulkWrite()` method.

**Answer:**
The `bulkWrite()` method allows you to perform multiple write operations (e.g., inserts, updates, deletes) in a single request. It supports batch operations and provides more efficient processing of bulk writes compared to individual operations.

## 58. How does MongoDB handle transactions?

**Answer:**
MongoDB supports multi-document transactions, allowing you to execute multiple operations atomically. Transactions ensure that all operations within the transaction are applied successfully or none at all. Transactions are managed using `startSession()`, `commitTransaction()`, and `abortTransaction()` methods.

## 59. What are the `read concerns` in MongoDB and how do they affect data consistency?

**Answer:**
Read concerns determine the level of isolation for read operations. Common read concerns include:

- **`local`:** Returns the most recent data from the primary node, regardless of replication.
- **`majority`:** Returns data that has been acknowledged by a majority of nodes, ensuring higher consistency but potentially higher latency.
- **`linearizable`:** Provides the most up-to-date data, reflecting the latest changes.

## 60. What is a `cursor` in MongoDB?

**Answer:**
A cursor is an object that allows you to iterate over the results of a query. When using methods like `find()`, MongoDB returns a cursor that you can use to retrieve documents one at a time or in batches. Cursors provide control over query execution and result retrieval.
