## 1. What is Django?

**Answer:** Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. It provides a robust set of tools and features, including an ORM (Object-Relational Mapper), an admin interface, and support for authentication and sessions.

## 2. What is the Django ORM?

**Answer:** Django ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) is a component of Django that provides a way to interact with the database using Python code instead of SQL queries. It allows developers to define their data models as Python classes and automatically handles the creation and manipulation of database tables.

## 3. What are Django models?

**Answer:** Django models are Python classes that define the structure of database tables. Each model class corresponds to a table in the database, and the class attributes represent the columns in the table. Models are used to create, retrieve, update, and delete records in the database.

## 4. What is a Django view?

**Answer:** A Django view is a Python function or class-based view that receives a web request and returns a web response. Views are responsible for processing user requests, interacting with models, and rendering responses, such as HTML pages or JSON data.

## 5. What is a Django template?

**Answer:** A Django template is a text file that defines the structure of HTML pages. It allows developers to create dynamic web content by embedding template tags and filters, which are replaced with actual values at runtime.

## 6. How does Django handle URL routing?

**Answer:** Django uses URLconf (URL configuration) to handle URL routing. URLconf maps URL patterns to corresponding views. This is done in the `urls.py` file, where developers define URL patterns using regular expressions or path converters and associate them with view functions or class-based views.

## 7. What is Django's admin interface?

**Answer:** Django's admin interface is a built-in feature that provides a web-based interface for managing the application's data. It allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on model records and is automatically generated based on the registered models.

## 8. What are Django middlewares?

**Answer:** Django middlewares are components that process requests and responses globally before they reach the view or after the view has processed them. Middlewares are used for various tasks, such as handling sessions, user authentication, and request logging.

## 9. What is the purpose of Django settings?

**Answer:** Django settings are a configuration module that defines various parameters for a Django project, such as database configurations, static files settings, and security options. The settings are typically stored in a file named `settings.py`.

## 10. How do you handle static files in Django?

**Answer:** Static files in Django, such as CSS, JavaScript, and images, are managed using the `STATICFILES` settings. During development, static files are served from the `STATIC_URL` directory. In production, static files are usually collected into a single directory using the `collectstatic` management command and served by the web server.

## 11. What are Django signals?

**Answer:** Django signals are a mechanism that allows certain senders to notify a set of receivers when certain actions occur. For example, signals can be used to perform additional actions when a model instance is saved or deleted.

## 12. What is Django's `migrations` system?

**Answer:** Django's migrations system manages changes to the database schema over time. Migrations are a way to apply and track changes to the models and database schema. They are generated using the `makemigrations` command and applied using the `migrate` command.

## 13. How does Django implement user authentication?

**Answer:** Django provides a built-in authentication system that includes features for user registration, login, logout, and password management. It uses the `User` model to handle user accounts and provides authentication views and decorators for restricting access to certain parts of the application.

## 14. What is the difference between `@login_required` and `UserPassesTestMixin`?

**Answer:** `@login_required` is a decorator used to restrict access to views only to authenticated users. `UserPassesTestMixin` is a class-based mixin that allows for more granular control by providing a method for custom access control based on user conditions.

## 15. Explain the purpose of `__str__` method in Django models.

**Answer:** The `__str__` method in Django models is used to define a human-readable string representation of a model instance. This method is called when the model instance is displayed in the Django admin interface or other places where the model instance needs to be represented as a string.

## 16. What is Django Rest Framework (DRF)?

**Answer:** Django Rest Framework (DRF) is a powerful and flexible toolkit for building Web APIs in Django. It provides a set of features to create, read, update, and delete data via HTTP methods and offers authentication, permissions, serialization, and viewsets for building RESTful APIs.

## 17. What are Django’s `Context` and `Request` objects?

**Answer:** In Django, `Context` is a dictionary-like object used to pass data to templates. `Request` represents the HTTP request and contains information such as request method, user, and GET/POST data. Both are crucial for rendering responses and handling requests in views.

## 18. Explain the purpose of Django’s `urlpatterns`.

**Answer:** `urlpatterns` is a list of URL patterns used by Django’s URL dispatcher to map URLs to view functions or class-based views. It is defined in the `urls.py` file and determines which view should be called for a given URL pattern.

## 19. How do you perform database queries in Django?

**Answer:** Database queries in Django are performed using the ORM’s QuerySet API. For example, to retrieve all objects of a model, you can use `Model.objects.all()`. QuerySets are lazy, meaning the query is only executed when the data is actually needed.

## 20. What is a Django form and how does it differ from a model form?

**Answer:** A Django form is a class used to handle and validate user input. `forms.Form` is used for general forms, whereas `forms.ModelForm` is specifically used to create forms based on a Django model. Model forms automatically generate form fields based on model fields.

## 21. What are Django’s `manage.py` commands and their purposes?

**Answer:** `manage.py` is a command-line utility that helps manage a Django project. Common commands include `runserver` (starts the development server), `migrate` (applies database migrations), `makemigrations` (creates migration files), `createsuperuser` (creates an admin user), and `collectstatic` (collects static files).

## 22. How does Django handle database migrations?

**Answer:** Django handles database migrations using migration files that track changes to models. These files are generated by the `makemigrations` command and applied using the `migrate` command. Migrations are used to update the database schema in a version-controlled manner.

## 23. What is the `django.contrib.sites` framework?

**Answer:** The `django.contrib.sites` framework allows Django projects to manage multiple sites with a single Django installation. It provides the `Site` model, which can be used to store and manage domain names and site-specific settings.

## 24. How do you configure Django for production?

**Answer:** For production, you need to configure Django with proper settings, including setting `DEBUG = False`, configuring allowed hosts with `ALLOWED_HOSTS`, setting up secure cookie settings, using a robust database backend, and configuring static and media file handling. Additionally, consider using a web server like Nginx or Apache and a WSGI server like Gunicorn.

## 25. What are Django signals and how are they used?

**Answer:** Django signals allow certain senders to notify a set of receivers when specific actions occur, such as saving or deleting a model instance. Signals are used to trigger additional actions or processes, such as sending notifications or updating related models.

## 26. What is the `AdminSite` class in Django?

**Answer:** The `AdminSite` class is part of Django’s admin framework and represents the admin interface. It provides functionality to register models, customize the admin interface, and manage how models are displayed and interacted with in the admin panel.

## 27. How do you implement caching in Django?

**Answer:** Django supports caching at multiple levels: per-view caching using the `cache_page` decorator, template fragment caching with the `{% cache %}` template tag, and low-level caching using Django’s cache API. Caching can improve performance by reducing the need to repeatedly fetch data or render templates.

## 28. What are custom template tags and filters in Django?

**Answer:** Custom template tags and filters allow developers to extend Django’s template language with new functionality. Template tags are used to include complex logic in templates, while filters modify variables before they are displayed. They are defined in custom template libraries.

## 29. Explain the role of `staticfiles` in Django.

**Answer:** The `staticfiles` app in Django is responsible for managing static files such as CSS, JavaScript, and images. It provides a mechanism for collecting and serving static files from various locations in a project and ensures that they are properly handled in both development and production environments.

## 30. What is Django’s `urlpatterns` variable and its purpose?

**Answer:** `urlpatterns` is a list of URL patterns in Django’s URL configuration that maps URLs to view functions or class-based views. It is defined in `urls.py` and tells Django how to route incoming requests to the appropriate view based on the URL pattern.
