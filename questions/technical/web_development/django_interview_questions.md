# Django Interview Questions and Answers -- Section A

## 1. What is Django?

**Answer:** Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. It provides a robust set of tools and features, including an ORM (Object-Relational Mapper), an admin interface, and support for authentication and sessions.

## 2. What is the Django ORM?

**Answer:** Django ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) is a component of Django that provides a way to interact with the database using Python code instead of SQL queries. It allows developers to define their data models as Python classes and automatically handles the creation and manipulation of database tables.

## 3. What are Django models?

**Answer:** Django models are Python classes that define the structure of database tables. Each model class corresponds to a table in the database, and the class attributes represent the columns in the table. Models are used to create, retrieve, update, and delete records in the database.

## 4. What is a Django view?

**Answer:** A Django view is a Python function or class-based view that receives a web request and returns a web response. Views are responsible for processing user requests, interacting with models, and rendering responses, such as HTML pages or JSON data.

## 5. What is a Django template?

**Answer:** A Django template is a text file that defines the structure of HTML pages. It allows developers to create dynamic web content by embedding template tags and filters, which are replaced with actual values at runtime.

## 6. How does Django handle URL routing?

**Answer:** Django uses URLconf (URL configuration) to handle URL routing. URLconf maps URL patterns to corresponding views. This is done in the `urls.py` file, where developers define URL patterns using regular expressions or path converters and associate them with view functions or class-based views.

## 7. What is Django's admin interface?

**Answer:** Django's admin interface is a built-in feature that provides a web-based interface for managing the application's data. It allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on model records and is automatically generated based on the registered models.

## 8. What are Django middlewares?

**Answer:** Django middlewares are components that process requests and responses globally before they reach the view or after the view has processed them. Middlewares are used for various tasks, such as handling sessions, user authentication, and request logging.

## 9. What is the purpose of Django settings?

**Answer:** Django settings are a configuration module that defines various parameters for a Django project, such as database configurations, static files settings, and security options. The settings are typically stored in a file named `settings.py`.

## 10. How do you handle static files in Django?

**Answer:** Static files in Django, such as CSS, JavaScript, and images, are managed using the `STATICFILES` settings. During development, static files are served from the `STATIC_URL` directory. In production, static files are usually collected into a single directory using the `collectstatic` management command and served by the web server.

## 11. What are Django signals?

**Answer:** Django signals are a mechanism that allows certain senders to notify a set of receivers when certain actions occur. For example, signals can be used to perform additional actions when a model instance is saved or deleted.

## 12. What is Django's `migrations` system?

**Answer:** Django's migrations system manages changes to the database schema over time. Migrations are a way to apply and track changes to the models and database schema. They are generated using the `makemigrations` command and applied using the `migrate` command.

## 13. How does Django implement user authentication?

**Answer:** Django provides a built-in authentication system that includes features for user registration, login, logout, and password management. It uses the `User` model to handle user accounts and provides authentication views and decorators for restricting access to certain parts of the application.

## 14. What is the difference between `@login_required` and `UserPassesTestMixin`?

**Answer:** `@login_required` is a decorator used to restrict access to views only to authenticated users. `UserPassesTestMixin` is a class-based mixin that allows for more granular control by providing a method for custom access control based on user conditions.

## 15. Explain the purpose of `__str__` method in Django models.

**Answer:** The `__str__` method in Django models is used to define a human-readable string representation of a model instance. This method is called when the model instance is displayed in the Django admin interface or other places where the model instance needs to be represented as a string.

# Django Interview Questions and Answers -- Section B

## 1. What is a Django query set?

**Answer:** A Django QuerySet is a collection of database queries that can be executed to retrieve objects from the database. It provides a high-level API to filter, order, and manipulate data. QuerySets are lazy; they are only evaluated when the data is actually needed.

## 2. What is the purpose of the `get()` method in Django’s QuerySet?

**Answer:** The `get()` method in Django’s QuerySet is used to retrieve a single object from the database that matches the given query. It raises a `DoesNotExist` exception if no objects are found and a `MultipleObjectsReturned` exception if more than one object matches the query.

## 3. Explain the use of `save()` method in Django models.

**Answer:** The `save()` method in Django models is used to save an instance of a model to the database. It can be overridden to customize the save behavior, such as modifying fields before saving or handling additional processing. By default, it inserts or updates the record in the database.

## 4. What is Django’s `TemplateView`?

**Answer:** `TemplateView` is a class-based view in Django that renders a template. It is used for simple views that only need to display a template with context data. It provides a `get()` method that processes HTTP GET requests and renders a specified template.

## 5. How do you perform validation in Django forms?

**Answer:** Validation in Django forms is performed using the `clean()` method and field-specific `clean_<fieldname>()` methods. The `clean()` method can be overridden to add custom validation logic, while field-specific methods validate individual fields. Validation errors are added to the form’s `errors` dictionary.

## 6. What are Django migrations and why are they important?

**Answer:** Django migrations are a way to propagate changes made to Django models into the database schema. They allow for version control of database changes, making it possible to apply incremental changes, roll back changes, and keep the database schema in sync with the models.

## 7. What is Django’s `Admin` interface, and how can it be customized?

**Answer:** Django’s `Admin` interface is a web-based interface for managing model data. It is automatically generated from registered models and provides an easy way to perform CRUD operations. It can be customized by creating a custom `ModelAdmin` class to modify the list display, form layout, filters, and more.

## 8. How do you handle file uploads in Django?

**Answer:** File uploads in Django are handled using `FileField` or `ImageField` in models. In the form, the file is uploaded via an HTML form with `enctype="multipart/form-data"`. The uploaded file is then accessible through the request’s `FILES` attribute and can be processed or saved using Django’s file handling methods.

## 9. What is Django’s `SessionMiddleware`?

**Answer:** `SessionMiddleware` is a middleware component in Django that manages user sessions. It stores session data on the server side and handles the assignment and retrieval of session data for each request. Sessions are used to persist user-specific data across requests.

## 10. What is the `@property` decorator in Django models?

**Answer:** The `@property` decorator in Django models is used to define a method that can be accessed like an attribute. It allows you to create computed properties that do not require storing data in the database but can provide useful information derived from other model fields.

## 11. Explain the use of Django’s `get_object_or_404()` function.

**Answer:** `get_object_or_404()` is a shortcut function in Django used to retrieve an object from the database. If the object is not found, it raises an `Http404` exception. It is commonly used in views to handle cases where the requested object may not exist and to provide a user-friendly error page.

## 12. What are Django’s class-based views (CBVs) and their benefits?

**Answer:** Django’s class-based views (CBVs) provide a way to handle views using classes rather than functions. They offer a more organized and reusable approach to view logic by utilizing inheritance and mixins. CBVs come with built-in generic views for common tasks like listing and creating objects.

## 13. How do you configure email settings in Django?

**Answer:** Email settings in Django are configured in the `settings.py` file using variables such as `EMAIL_BACKEND`, `EMAIL_HOST`, `EMAIL_PORT`, `EMAIL_USE_TLS`, `EMAIL_USE_SSL`, and `EMAIL_HOST_USER`/`EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD`. These settings define the email backend and server details used for sending emails.

## 14. What is the purpose of Django’s `manage.py shell`?

**Answer:** The `manage.py shell` command opens an interactive Python shell with Django’s context. It allows developers to interact with Django models, run queries, and test code snippets in the context of the Django project without needing to write and execute scripts.

## 15. How can you optimize database queries in Django?

**Answer:** Database queries in Django can be optimized by using techniques such as query optimization (e.g., using `select_related` and `prefetch_related` to reduce database hits), indexing important fields, avoiding N+1 query problems, and using Django’s query optimization features like database functions and annotations.
