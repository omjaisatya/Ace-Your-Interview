# Django Interview Questions and Answers -- Section A

## 1. What is Django?

**Answer:** Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. It provides a robust set of tools and features, including an ORM (Object-Relational Mapper), an admin interface, and support for authentication and sessions.

## 2. What is the Django ORM?

**Answer:** Django ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) is a component of Django that provides a way to interact with the database using Python code instead of SQL queries. It allows developers to define their data models as Python classes and automatically handles the creation and manipulation of database tables.

## 3. What are Django models?

**Answer:** Django models are Python classes that define the structure of database tables. Each model class corresponds to a table in the database, and the class attributes represent the columns in the table. Models are used to create, retrieve, update, and delete records in the database.

## 4. What is a Django view?

**Answer:** A Django view is a Python function or class-based view that receives a web request and returns a web response. Views are responsible for processing user requests, interacting with models, and rendering responses, such as HTML pages or JSON data.

## 5. What is a Django template?

**Answer:** A Django template is a text file that defines the structure of HTML pages. It allows developers to create dynamic web content by embedding template tags and filters, which are replaced with actual values at runtime.

## 6. How does Django handle URL routing?

**Answer:** Django uses URLconf (URL configuration) to handle URL routing. URLconf maps URL patterns to corresponding views. This is done in the `urls.py` file, where developers define URL patterns using regular expressions or path converters and associate them with view functions or class-based views.

## 7. What is Django's admin interface?

**Answer:** Django's admin interface is a built-in feature that provides a web-based interface for managing the application's data. It allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on model records and is automatically generated based on the registered models.

## 8. What are Django middlewares?

**Answer:** Django middlewares are components that process requests and responses globally before they reach the view or after the view has processed them. Middlewares are used for various tasks, such as handling sessions, user authentication, and request logging.

## 9. What is the purpose of Django settings?

**Answer:** Django settings are a configuration module that defines various parameters for a Django project, such as database configurations, static files settings, and security options. The settings are typically stored in a file named `settings.py`.

## 10. How do you handle static files in Django?

**Answer:** Static files in Django, such as CSS, JavaScript, and images, are managed using the `STATICFILES` settings. During development, static files are served from the `STATIC_URL` directory. In production, static files are usually collected into a single directory using the `collectstatic` management command and served by the web server.

## 11. What are Django signals?

**Answer:** Django signals are a mechanism that allows certain senders to notify a set of receivers when certain actions occur. For example, signals can be used to perform additional actions when a model instance is saved or deleted.

## 12. What is Django's `migrations` system?

**Answer:** Django's migrations system manages changes to the database schema over time. Migrations are a way to apply and track changes to the models and database schema. They are generated using the `makemigrations` command and applied using the `migrate` command.

## 13. How does Django implement user authentication?

**Answer:** Django provides a built-in authentication system that includes features for user registration, login, logout, and password management. It uses the `User` model to handle user accounts and provides authentication views and decorators for restricting access to certain parts of the application.

## 14. What is the difference between `@login_required` and `UserPassesTestMixin`?

**Answer:** `@login_required` is a decorator used to restrict access to views only to authenticated users. `UserPassesTestMixin` is a class-based mixin that allows for more granular control by providing a method for custom access control based on user conditions.

## 15. Explain the purpose of `__str__` method in Django models.

**Answer:** The `__str__` method in Django models is used to define a human-readable string representation of a model instance. This method is called when the model instance is displayed in the Django admin interface or other places where the model instance needs to be represented as a string.
