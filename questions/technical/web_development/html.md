# HTML Interview Questions and Answers

### 1. What is HTML?

**Answer:**  
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. It describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.

### 2. What are tags in HTML?

**Answer:**  
Tags are the fundamental building blocks of HTML. They define how elements should be displayed in the web browser. Tags are usually paired, with an opening tag (e.g., `<p>`) and a closing tag (e.g., `</p>`), although some tags are self-closing (e.g., `<img />`).

### 3. What is the difference between HTML and XHTML?

**Answer:**  
HTML is the standard markup language, while XHTML (Extensible Hypertext Markup Language) is a stricter, XML-based version of HTML. XHTML requires all elements to be properly closed, nested, and written in lowercase.

Semantic HTML elements clearly describe their meaning in a human- and machine-readable way. Examples include `<article>`, `<footer>`, `<header>`, `<nav>`, and `<section>`.

### 5. How do you include CSS in an HTML document?

**Answer:**  
CSS can be included in an HTML document in three ways:

- Internal: using a `<style>` element within the `<head>` section of the HTML document.
- External: linking to an external CSS file using the `<link>` element within the `<head>` section.

### 6. What is the purpose of the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration?

### 7. Explain the difference between `<div>` and `<span>`.

**Answer:**

- `<div>`: A block-level element used to group larger sections of content. It starts on a new line and takes up the full width available.

### 8. What is the role of the `alt` attribute in the `<img>` tag?
