# Authentication Notes

## What Is Authentication?

Authentication is the process of identifying users that request access to a system, network, server, app, website, or device. The primary goal of authentication is to ensure that a user is who they claim to be. Authentication improves security by allowing an organizational admin to manage an individual user’s identity and access. The basic authentication used for identity and access control verification is username and password, with different types of authentication techniques available.

## Why Is User Authentication Important?

No organization, system, network, website, or server today can function securely without authentication. Without it, organizations risk cyber attacks such as phishing, data breaches, and spoofing. Proper authentication measures ensure that sensitive data remains protected and unauthorized users are prevented from accessing private information.

## Different Types of Authentication

When implementing authentication, consider the security capability and usability of each method. Below are the main types of authentication:

### 1. Password-Based Login

The most common authentication method requiring a username/mobile number and password. However, users often reuse passwords, leading to security risks like phishing and data breaches. This is why password-based authentication is increasingly being supplemented with additional security layers.

### 2. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

MFA requires multiple factors for authentication, adding an extra layer of security. Users must enter a second factor such as an OTP (One-Time Password) via SMS, email, or authentication apps (Google, Microsoft, Authy). This method significantly reduces unauthorized access risks.

### 3. Biometric Authentication

Biometric authentication verifies identity using physical attributes such as fingerprints, retinas, voice, or facial recognition. It is widely used in organizations, airports, and high-security areas. Common biometric methods include:

- **Fingerprint Authentication**: Uses unique fingerprint patterns.
- **Retina & Iris Scanning**: Analyzes eye patterns for authentication.
- **Facial Recognition**: Scans facial features for identity verification.
- **Voice Recognition**: Uses voice tone and patterns for authentication.

### 4. Certificate-Based Authentication

This method uses digital certificates containing a public key and a certification authority’s digital signature. Users present their digital certificates to log in, ensuring high security.

### 5. Token-Based Authentication

Users enter credentials once and receive a unique encrypted token for future logins. This method is commonly used for API authentication in Restful APIs.

## Advanced Authentication Solutions

### **Single Sign-On (SSO)**

SSO allows users to enter credentials once and access multiple applications without re-entering passwords. This improves security and reduces the need for password resets.

### **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**

2FA requires two authentication steps, adding an additional layer of security. Methods include OTPs, push notifications, biometrics, hardware tokens, and authenticator apps.

### **Adaptive Authentication**

Adaptive Authentication applies security policies based on IP, device, location, and time of access. It enhances security by restricting access based on abnormal patterns.

### **API Authentication**

API authentication secures data exchanges between applications. Common methods include:

- **HTTP Basic Authentication**: Uses username and password in HTTP headers.
- **API Keys**: Unique identifiers for authentication requests.
- **OAuth**: A widely used protocol that enables both authentication and authorization.

Authentication is crucial for securing systems, networks, and data. Implementing strong authentication mechanisms helps prevent cyber threats and unauthorized access, ensuring a safe digital environment.

# OAuth vs JWT: What Is the Difference? Can You Use Them Together?

## What Is OAuth?

OAuth (Open Authorization) is a standard for token-based authentication over public networks. It allows third-party services (e.g., Google, Facebook) to use user account information without exposing login credentials. OAuth acts as an intermediary, granting access tokens to authorized third-party services.

## What Is JWT?

JWT (JSON Web Token) is a standard for securely exchanging information between entities (typically a client and a server). JWTs are self-contained, cryptographically signed tokens that store user data and claims.

## Key Differences

| Feature          | OAuth                                       | JWT                                                |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**      | Authorization                               | Authentication & Information Exchange              |
| **Security**     | Secure authorization flow                   | Secure as part of a well-designed system           |
| **Statefulness** | Stateful (requires an authorization server) | Stateless (self-contained, no server dependency)   |
| **Use Cases**    | Session management, third-party access      | API authentication, server-to-server authorization |
| **Tokens**       | Uses unique tokens for access               | Self-contained tokens with claims                  |

OAuth and JWT can be used together. For example, an authentication server may verify credentials and use OAuth to send JWTs to a client application.

## Pros and Cons

### OAuth

✅ **Pros:**

- Widely used and supported
- Many plug-and-play solutions (e.g., Google, Facebook login)
- Secure and well-tested

❌ **Cons:**

- Complex setup and multiple authorization flows
- May not be necessary for simple applications
- Potential privacy concerns (e.g., tracking user logins across sites)

### JWT

✅ **Pros:**

- Eliminates repeated database queries
- Fast verification (no database lookup required)
- Secure and tamper-proof (digitally signed)

❌ **Cons:**

- Cannot be easily revoked
- If the signing key is compromised, attackers can generate valid JWTs
- Requires additional security measures for immediate revocation

## When to Use JWT vs. OAuth

| Use Case                           | Recommended Approach |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| API authentication                 | JWT                  |
| Web, API, and browser applications | OAuth                |
| Stateless applications             | JWT                  |
| Third-party access management      | OAuth                |
| Complex security needs             | OAuth + JWT          |

## Using JWT with OAuth2

- OAuth2 does not specify a token format, so JWT can be used as the `access_token`.
- JWTs can reduce round trips between authentication and resource servers.
- OpenID Connect (OIDC) extends OAuth2, adding an `id_token` for identity management.
- Security in OAuth2 depends on proper authorization flow selection rather than token type.

## Final Thoughts

Both OAuth and JWT are powerful tools in authentication and authorization. OAuth is best for managing permissions and third-party access, while JWT is ideal for stateless authentication. Combining them provides enhanced performance and security.

# **Web Loading**

## **Why Should a Website Load Fast?**

Users prefer fast-loading websites over slow ones. However, website speed is more than just a preference—it directly impacts success.

- A slow website increases bounce rates, which signals search engines that the content is not useful, leading to lower rankings.
- Ecommerce businesses lose customers if their checkout pages load even a fraction of a second slower than competitors.
- A **Statista survey** found that user abandonment significantly increases after **5 seconds** of wait time.

### **Statistics on Page Load Time and User Behavior**

- **1 in 4** visitors leave a site if it takes more than **4 seconds** to load.
- Every **1-second delay** reduces **user satisfaction by 16%**.
- **64% of dissatisfied shoppers** do not return to a slow website.
- **70% of consumers** say that page speed influences their online purchasing decisions.
- Each additional second of load time **reduces conversion rates by 4.42%** (in the first five seconds).

## **What is Website Load Time?**

**Website load time** refers to the total time taken for a web page to fully load and appear on the screen, including text, images, videos, and other elements.

### **Factors Affecting Page Load Time:**

- **Page Type** – Complex pages with many elements take longer to load.
- **User Behavior** – Returning visitors may experience faster load times due to caching.
- **File Sizes** – Large images, videos, and scripts slow down page speed.
- **Website Server/Hosting** – Poor hosting can lead to slow responses.
- **Inefficient Coding** – Bloated or unoptimized code affects performance.
- **Hotlinking** – Using images or assets hosted on external servers can slow down load times.
- **Too Many Plugins/Widgets** – Excessive plugins increase load times and resource consumption.

### **Difference Between Page Speed and Site Speed**

- **Page Speed** refers to the load time of an individual page.
  - Can be measured as **page-load time** (time taken to fully display content) or **time to first byte (TTFB)** (time taken to load the first byte of data from the server).
- **Site Speed** refers to the overall performance of the entire website, based on multiple page loads.

# How is Web Page Speed Measured: Key Metrics

Website speed refers to how quickly a site loads for visitors. It is based on an average of multiple page speeds. Page speed (or page load time) is the time it takes for all elements of a web page, such as text and graphics, to fully load.

Research indicates that users tend to leave if a website takes more than 400 milliseconds to load—less than the blink of an eye!

## Key Metrics for Measuring Web Page Speed

- **Time to First Byte (TTFB):** Measures how long it takes for a browser to receive the first response from the server after making a request.
- **Page Load Time:** Determines how long it takes to fully load a specific page.
- **Server Response Time:** Tracks the time required to get a complete response from the server.
- **First Contentful Paint (FCP):** The time taken for the first visible piece of content (text, image, etc.) to appear on the screen.
- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP):** Measures the time it takes to load the largest visible content element (text or image).
- **First Input Delay (FID):** Tracks the time between a user interaction (clicking a button or link) and when the browser begins to process it.
- **User Engagement Metrics:** Includes bounce rate, session duration, and conversion rates.
- **HTML Parsing Time & Script Execution:** Time taken to parse HTML into a DOM and execute scripts.
- **Round Trip Time (RTT):** Measures the total time for an HTTP request to reach the server and for the response to return.

## How Fast Should Your Website Load?

The short answer: **as fast as possible!**

- In 2023, the **average page load time** is **2.5 seconds on desktop** and **8.6 seconds on mobile**.
- Google aims for load times of **less than 0.5 seconds**.
- On a **3G connection**, the average mobile website load time is **19 seconds**.

### Industry-Wise Average Load Times:

- **Automotive Retail:** 6 seconds
- **Consumer Goods:** 6.1 seconds
- **Financial Websites:** 5.1 seconds
- **Healthcare Websites:** 5.6 seconds
- **Media Websites:** 5.5 seconds
- **Retail Websites:** 6 seconds
- **Technology Websites:** 6.8 seconds
- **Travel Websites:** 6.7 seconds

### First Input Delay (FID) Averages:

- **Desktop FID:** 12.73 milliseconds
- **Mobile FID:** 59.73 milliseconds (Mobile pages load 70.9% slower than desktop)

## Impact of Slow Load Times on Bounce Rate

Studies show that slow websites have **negative effects on user engagement and Google rankings**:

- **1s to 3s load time:** Bounce rate increases by **32%**
- **1s to 5s load time:** Bounce rate increases by **90%**
- **1s to 6s load time:** Bounce rate increases by **106%**
- **1s to 10s load time:** Bounce rate increases by **123%**

# Reasons for Slow Load Time

Every website must be optimized for the fastest possible speed, regardless of the device-browser-operating system combinations that visit it. To implement appropriate optimization strategies, developers must understand these fundamental causes of slow website loading and how to address them to increase traffic, revenue, and trustworthiness.

## 1. Poor Server Performance

When a user clicks on a website, the browser pings the server, requesting all the necessary information to load the website. If the server’s performance is subpar, it takes longer to respond, slowing down the site's load time.

- Bad server performance is typically due to the quality of the web host.
- Shared servers slow down performance due to multiple websites using the same resources.

## 2. Unsuitable Server Location

The further the user is from the server location, the longer it takes to load the site.

- A person in the U.S. accessing a website with a Danish server will experience longer load times.

## 3. Heavy Traffic

A web server can only handle a certain number of user requests at a time. If traffic exceeds this threshold, the page will load more slowly.

- High-traffic websites need additional resources to handle increased visitors.
- Without an upgrade, conversion rates may suffer due to slow loading times.

## 4. Excessive Flash Content

Flash can enhance interactivity but also slow down load times.

- Flash files tend to be heavier.
- Consider replacing Flash with HTML5 for better performance.

## 5. Increased HTTP Requests

Excessive use of JavaScript, CSS, and image files increases HTTP requests, slowing down loading times.

- Reducing the number of files can speed up page load time.

## 6. Code Density

Complex and dense code can slow website performance.

- Optimize and streamline code to enhance speed.
- Remove unnecessary scripts and comments.

## 7. Inadequate Caching Techniques

Caching allows browsers to store frequently accessed data.

- Without caching, browsers must reload all files each time the website is visited.
- Implementing proper caching reduces load times significantly.

## 8. Too Many Ads

Ads increase HTTP requests, further slowing page load speeds.

- Rich media ads, pop-ups, and auto-downloads significantly impact performance.
- Limiting ad quantity improves page speed and user experience.

## 9. Using an Outdated CMS

Content Management Systems (CMS) like WordPress and Wix require regular updates.

- Keeping CMS software up to date ensures optimal performance.
- Speed optimization plugins help improve loading times.

## 10. Lack of a CDN

A Content Delivery Network (CDN) distributes website content across multiple servers worldwide.

- CDNs assign local servers to users based on their location.
- This reduces round-trip time (RTT) and improves page load speed.

# OAuth vs JWT: What Is the Difference? Can You Use Them Together?

## What Is OAuth?

OAuth (Open Authorization) is a standard for token-based authentication over public networks. It allows third-party services (e.g., Facebook, Google) to use end-user account information without exposing credentials. OAuth acts as an intermediary, providing access tokens to authorized services.

## What Is JWT?

JWT (JSON Web Token) is an industry standard for sharing information between a client (frontend) and a server (backend). A JWT contains a JSON object with information (claims) and is cryptographically signed to prevent modification.

OAuth and JWT serve different purposes:

- **OAuth** is used for **authorization** (delegating user access to third-party apps).
- **JWT** is used for **authentication** (verifying and sharing user information).

## OAuth vs. JWT: Key Differences

| Feature          | OAuth                                     | JWT                                               |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Function**     | Authorization                             | Authentication & information exchange             |
| **Security**     | Secure authorization flow                 | Self-contained but requires secure implementation |
| **Statefulness** | Stateful (relies on authorization server) | Stateless (no external validation needed)         |
| **Applications** | Web, API, and session-based apps          | Stateless API authentication                      |
| **Tokens**       | Grants access to resources                | Encodes user claims in a signed token             |

OAuth and JWT can be used together, such as when an authentication server uses OAuth to transmit JWTs to a client application.

## OAuth vs JWT: Pros and Cons

### OAuth Advantages

- Widely used, with strong adoption and community support.
- Many plug-and-play solutions (e.g., "Sign in with Google").
- Secure and field-tested.

### OAuth Disadvantages

- Can be complex for beginners.
- Might be overkill for simple apps.
- Potential privacy concerns (OAuth provider tracks logins).

### JWT Advantages

- Reduces the need for database queries by storing user details.
- Can be efficiently verified without external calls.
- Strong security (digitally signed and tamper-proof).

### JWT Disadvantages

- Cannot be easily revoked without additional engineering.
- Compromised signing key can lead to security risks.

## When to Use JWT vs. OAuth

- **JWT** is best for **API authentication** and **stateless applications**.
- **OAuth** is better for **web apps and third-party integrations**.

| Feature        | JWT                  | OAuth                            |
| -------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Use Cases**  | APIs, microservices  | Web, API, and browser-based apps |
| **Tokens**     | Defines token format | Defines authorization protocols  |
| **Complexity** | Easier to implement  | More complex but flexible        |
| **Storage**    | Client-side only     | Client-side & server-side        |
| **Scope**      | Limited, lightweight | Broader use cases                |

## Using JWT with OAuth2

JWT and OAuth2 can work together:

- OAuth2 does not specify a token format, so JWT can be used as an access token.
- JWT can reduce round trips between authentication and resource servers.
- OpenID Connect (OIDC) extends OAuth2 to include ID tokens for additional security.

However, **using JWT does not inherently increase security** in OAuth2-based applications. OAuth2 security depends more on selecting the right authorization flow than the type of token used.

### Final Thoughts

If you need a simple, stateless authentication mechanism, JWT is a great choice. If your application involves third-party access, user delegation, or session management, OAuth is more suitable. In some cases, combining both provides the best balance of security and efficiency.
